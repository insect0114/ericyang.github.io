        <!-- Overview -->
        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>
          This project analyzes a dataset of video games containing sexual or adult content to
          understand how reward and punishment structures are designed around player behavior.
          The work combines quantitative analysis of publicly available game data with qualitative
          interpretation of tags, genres, and presentation to explore how “ludic eroticism” is
          implemented in contemporary game media.
        </p>
        <p>
          The goal is to move beyond surface-level labels (e.g., “adult,” “NSFW”) and examine how
          mechanics, pricing, and visibility shape the way players engage with sexualized content
          in games.
        </p>

        <!-- Research Questions -->
        <h2>Research Questions</h2>
        <p>
          The project is guided by questions such as:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            How are reward and punishment loops structured in games that include sexual or adult content?
          </li>
          <li>
            Are there observable patterns in pricing, reviews, or tags that distinguish different
            “types” of adult-oriented games?
          </li>
          <li>
            How do players respond to these designs, as reflected in reviews, ratings, and engagement?
          </li>
        </ul>

        <!-- Data & Sources -->
        <h2>Data & Sources</h2>
        <p>
          The project uses a curated dataset of games tagged with sexual or adult content on a major
          PC distribution platform. The dataset includes:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Game titles and release years,</li>
          <li>Tags, genres, and content descriptors,</li>
          <li>Prices and discounts at time of capture,</li>
          <li>Review counts and average ratings, and</li>
          <li>Basic metadata relevant to visibility and positioning on the platform.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          This structured data is used as a base for quantitative analysis, with selected entries
          examined in more detail to support qualitative interpretation.
        </p>

        <!-- Methods -->
        <h2>Methods</h2>
        <p>
          The project uses a mixed methods approach, integrating quantitative and qualitative work:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Quantitative analysis:</strong> descriptive statistics and visualizations of trends in release year,
            pricing, tags, and review patterns across the dataset.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Qualitative coding:</strong> categorizing how sexual content is framed (e.g., comedic, romantic,
            transactional, exploitative) based on tags, descriptions, and example titles.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Comparative analysis:</strong> contrasting subsets of games (e.g., higher vs. lower rated, cheaper vs.
            premium-priced) to see how design and reception differ.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          The mixed methods design allows numerical trends to be grounded in concrete examples of
          how gameplay and erotic elements are actually implemented.
        </p>

        <!-- Reward–Punishment Loop -->
        <h2>Reward–Punishment Loop Perspective</h2>
        <p>
          A key lens in this project is the reward–punishment loop: how games structure incentives,
          feedback, and friction around erotic or adult content. Specific aspects examined include:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Whether progression towards explicit content is gated behind grinding, skill, payment, or
            narrative choices.
          </li>
          <li>
            How failure, loss, or “bad” outcomes are framed in relation to romantic or sexual content.
          </li>
          <li>
            The extent to which erotic elements are optional, core to the loop, or used as an extrinsic reward.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          This framing connects game design decisions with broader questions about motivation,
          compulsion, and player agency in adult-oriented media.
        </p>

        <!-- Process -->
        <h2>Process</h2>
        <p>
          The project has progressed through several stages:
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li>
            <strong>Data preparation:</strong> loading, cleaning, and restructuring the dataset for analysis
            (handling missing values, normalizing tags, and formatting dates and prices).
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Exploratory analysis:</strong> generating initial plots to examine distributions of release years,
            price ranges, tags, and review metrics.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Focused segmentation:</strong> defining subgroups of games (e.g., highly reviewed vs. niche) for
            deeper comparative analysis.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Qualitative review:</strong> selecting example titles from each subgroup to interpret how
            mechanics and themes embody different styles of ludic eroticism.
          </li>
        </ol>

        <!-- Tools & Implementation -->
        <h2>Tools & Implementation</h2>
        <p>
          The quantitative side of the project is implemented using:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Python for data handling and analysis,</li>
          <li>Pandas for cleaning and transforming tabular data,</li>
          <li>Matplotlib and/or Seaborn for data visualization, and</li>
          <li>Jupyter-style workflows for iterative exploration.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Visual outputs include line charts of releases over time, distributions of price and review
          counts, and categorical breakdowns of tags and genres.
        </p>

        <!-- Contributions -->
        <h2>My Contributions</h2>
        <p>
          Within this project, my responsibilities include:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Designing the overall mixed methods strategy and deciding how to combine quantitative
            and qualitative work,
          </li>
          <li>
            Cleaning and structuring the dataset for reproducible analysis,
          </li>
          <li>
            Implementing exploratory and focused visualizations of key variables, and
          </li>
          <li>
            Interpreting how observed patterns relate to theories of gamification, reward structures,
            and player behavior.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <!-- Status & Outcomes -->
        <h2>Status & Outcomes</h2>
        <p>
          The analysis has produced a set of descriptive findings about how adult-oriented games
          are positioned and received on the platform, along with case-based insights into how
          erotic content is woven into reward loops and progression systems.
        </p>
        <p>
          Next steps include refining the visualizations for presentation, tightening the
          qualitative categories used to describe different design patterns, and integrating the
          results into a broader written piece on the gamification of ludic eroticism in digital games.
